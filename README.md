# better-spotify-wrapped

A simple CLI tool that can parse extended lifetime listening data from Spotify [which can be downloaded here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/). The data is parsed from raw listening history data to JSON files containing aggregated listening data, which can then be queried for interesting insights into your listening.

##### Disclaimer: This tool was my first ever Go project. Do not expect it to be perfect (or to work for that matter).
